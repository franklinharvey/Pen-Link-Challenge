# Pen Link Innovation Challenge

#### Quick Start
* run `localServer.sh`
* navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)

Everything in this repo is **not dependent** on NPM or any type of installed dependency. You can just download/clone this repo and run with it. I included a quick HTTP server in `localServer.sh`. Running that, or any HTTP server from the root of this doc will lead you to `/index.html` which includes my vanilla JS example. There is also a link the `/react/index.html` which is my react component in action. The code for this component is in `/js/PL_react_component.js`. 

#### Unit Testing
In order to do proper unit testing I had to use NPM, so I made a seperate repo. This was only so I could share this static example more easily, like in a zip file, without requiring someone to install dependencies and build the site. You can see my unit tests and the testing in action at [https://github.com/franklinharvey/PL-Challenge-Enzyme-Tests](/https://github.com/franklinharvey/PL-Challenge-Enzyme-Tests)
